# Time-Series-and-Forecasting

**Scenario**: The ability to accurately estimate ambulance demand is extremely valuable to emergency service providers and residents of a community. However, owing to complicated multi-nature connections and nonlinear dynamics within ambulance demand, such as geographic factors involving the part of the city where the demand is calculated, short and long-term historical needs, and the demography of an area, this work has proven difficult.

**Conclusion**: After analysis of the obtained results, we can conclude that the calls can be forecasted to the nearly accurate values. Based on the rmse and mse values on different models, Auto-Arima predicted with the least error (rmse = 5.33). As we had 151 days of data to predict, the other models can be treated or optimised to predict better. We can use machine learning models as well to predict better.
